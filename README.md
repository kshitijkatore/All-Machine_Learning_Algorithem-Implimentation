# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains hands-on implementations of various machine learning algorithms using Python and popular data science libraries. Each folder demonstrates a different algorithm or technique with Jupyter notebooks and example datasets.

## Project Structure

- **01_Simple_Linear_Regression/**: Implementation of simple linear regression using a real-world height and weight dataset.
- **02_Multiple_Regression/**: Implementation of multiple regression using economic data.
- **03_Polynomial_Regression/**: Implementation of polynomial regression, and notebooks for handling imbalanced datasets and missing values.

## Requirements

All notebooks require the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements.
3. Open any notebook in Jupyter or VSCode and run the cells.
